  <p>
    I am a Master's student in Health Informatics at Cornell University and a Research Assistant at the UCF Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV), 
    working with Dr. Chen Chen. My research focuses on developing efficient video understanding systems and medical image analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    My recent work includes the A.I.R. framework for adaptive frame selection in video question answering, which achieves state-of-the-art performance 
    while reducing computational costs by ~74%. I also contributed to developing HFA-UNet for thyroid nodule segmentation, achieving significant improvements 
    in medical imaging benchmarks.
