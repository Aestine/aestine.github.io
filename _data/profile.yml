    I am a recent MS graduate in Health Informatics from Cornell University (GPA: 4.03/4.30, Academic Excellence) 
    and currently serve as a Research Assistant at UCF's Center for Research in Computer Vision under Dr. Chen Chen. 
    My educational background combines health informatics with computer science and AI from my undergraduate studies at UNNC.

  <p>
    My research focuses on bridging computer vision and healthcare applications, with particular interests in 
    efficient video understanding, medical image segmentation, and multimodal learning. I aim to develop practical AI systems 
    that balance computational efficiency with high performance for real-world deployment in both clinical and general vision tasks.
