  We developed a multi-modal VGG16-MLP architecture that integrates OCT scans and patient clinical labels (BCVA, CST) using guided-loss alignment for knowledge transfer between modalities. Our semi-supervised training approach with pseudo-labeling on the RECOVERY dataset demonstrates improved joint feature learning for ophthalmic biomarker detection.
