  We propose HFA-UNet, a hybrid Transformer-based segmentation model featuring a full-attention multi-scale fusion stage (FA-MSF) that uses atrous convolutions to gather multi-scale context and integrates CBAM to enhance boundary features. Our adaptive skip connection mechanism dynamically adjusts based on input image resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple public datasets (DDTI, TN3K, Stanford Cine-Clip) with Dice score improvements up to 2.36% and mIoU up to 4.88%.
