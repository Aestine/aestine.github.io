  We propose A.I.R., a training-free framework for adaptive frame selection in Video Question Answering that addresses the critical trade-off between lightweight models' poor performance and VLM-based methods' prohibitive computational costs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks (Video-MME, MLVU, LVB, EgoSchema, NextQA) while reducing inference time by ~74% compared to conventional VLM-based analysis.
